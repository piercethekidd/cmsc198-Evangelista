# July Week 2

## Todo
- Create the WebSocket Server using RatchetPHP and Laravel that will deliver messages to the clients of the system.
- Update the User Interface based on the comments and suggestions given by my supervisors.

## Done
- Created the WebSocket Server
- Updated the User Interface

## To be done
- Finish the whole chat system that will be integrated with the rest of the modules.

## Things learned
- This week I learned that our experiences collectively teach us to be better at what we do. It helps us I learned that not all things can be learned from school and the value of experience is irreplaceable.

## Hardest task done this week
- The hardest task I've done this week is setting up the server not because it is really hard. In fact, it is very easy with the help of Ratchet's excellent documentation. It is just the "most difficult" task I have done for this week. I think the next week's todos will be more difficult and will be quite challenging because by next week I should be able to come up with a system that can send and receive messages across clients.
