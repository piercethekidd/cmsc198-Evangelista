# June Week 5

## Todo
- Continue to study about Long Polling and WebSockets.
- Prepare a powerpoint presentation that discusses the advantages and disadvantages of Web Sockets and Long Polling so that the technology which will be used on my module will be decided.
- Start on the assigned module's design.

## Done
- I presented and discussed Long Polling and WebSockets' advantages and disadvantages. Like when and where it is appropriate and inappropriate to use. After the final decision has been made that WebSockets are to be used in our project, I was tasked to proceed in implementing it.
- I successfully integrated WebSockets with our project using Ratchet PHP. 	
- I have showcased a chat application demo using Ratchet PHP during our weekly meeting/report. 

## To be done
- To further develop the chat module using Materialize and Ratchet in compliance with the updated wireframes.

## Things learned
- This week I learned the importance of communication skills and its impact in work-related tasks. It is crucial if we are going to present a report in front of our colleagues or in a different scenario, when we are going to ask for assistance when we are in a bit of a trouble. To effectively carry out a very pleasing, informative, and wonderful presentation, one must have an effective set of communication skills.

## Hardest task done this week
- The hardest task I've done this week is when I have to integrate Ratchet PHP with our project because WebSockets is a relatively new technology. There are only a few tutorials that exist out there. Luckily I have found something that has helped me a lot. I studied it and because of it, I was successful in doing my task.
