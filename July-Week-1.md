## Things learned
- I learned this week that sometimes you are just lucky to have co-workers that have your back when you are in trouble. This happened to me this week because I was in a bit of a trouble while I was thinking of a proper UI design. Sometimes you just have good colleagues, sometimes you don't.

## Hardest task done this week
- The hardest task I've done this week is designing the User Interface. It is very hard to think of a design that is gonna suit the target user's needs. I found it hard it to do because the target user's are middle aged with no to little experience with computers. But luckily, through the help of my co-interns' wireframes, I have successfully managed to overcome this struggle.
