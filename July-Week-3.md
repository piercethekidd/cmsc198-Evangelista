# July Week 3

## Todo
- Finish the basic functionalities of the Chat Application to be used by the Swine E-Commerce System. It should send and retrieve messages in real time using Web Sockets and should also be able to notify the user 

## Done
- Was able to finish the whole module with minor UI deficiencies.

## To be done
- There are no more things to be done since this is the last week.

## Things learned
- At first, I thought that doing my task was impossible for me to finish because it seemed like it was very difficult, basing my judgement on my experience in using PHP. I have little experience using it so I had to teach myself so I can effectively contribute to the team I belong to. I learned that it's not gonna always be easy to finish a given task. But if you believe that you can do it and you are willing to learn, then you increase the probability of you accomplishing what you have worked hard for.

## Hardest task done this week
- The hardest task I've done this week is fixing the WebSocket server so that it will only send messages to target clients. I have spent so much time just thinking about the implementation I will use. Once I was done, I fixed the User Interface. It was the next hardest thing I've done.
